# Fluent Scenarios

*Still in early development, more documentation coming soon!*

A light weight testing library for writing higher level test scenarios.

## Goal of the project

This project was started because I wanted to have a tool that enables me to write
higher level test scenarios on all the operating systems I develop software on: 
Linux, MacOS and Windows. I had previously tried out SpecFlow, but unfortunately
there was only proper tooling for Visual Studio on Windows. Also, I have for a while
wanted to further enable code bases to the single source of truth. Thus, these are
the two main goals with this project:

1. Provide a testing library for writing test scenarios
that would work on all platforms .Net Core works on.

2. Let the code be the single source of truth, so that documentation could
be generated from the code base.
